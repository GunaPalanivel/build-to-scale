# Build to Scale: 6-Month Engineering Excellence Roadmap

## Overview

This repository documents a comprehensive, metrics-driven 6-month learning journey designed to transform a software engineering graduate into a top 0.0001% candidate ready for elite product companies (FAANG, Stripe, Uber, etc.) and the ThinkBridge Software Engineer Apprentice Program.

## Objectives

- Master HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+, Firebase (ThinkBridge assessment tech stack)
- Build Java expertise for long-term backend career growth
- Achieve 9/10 proficiency across all critical skill areas
- Complete 45+ production-quality projects with measurable impact
- Pass 95%+ of mock technical and behavioral interviews
- Develop systems thinking with trade-off analysis and scale awareness

## Repository Structure

- **PLANS/**: Week-by-week learning plans (24 weeks, 168 days)
- **PLANS_PERFORMANCE_REPORT/**: Actual vs expected outcomes tracking
- **PROJECTS/**: Source code and documentation for all projects
- **ASSESSMENTS/**: Weekly and monthly skill assessments
- **BEHAVIORAL_PREP/**: Interview stories using LP-STAR framework
- **SYSTEM_DESIGN/**: Architecture case studies and diagrams
- **RESOURCES/**: Curated learning materials
- **METRICS/**: KPI tracking and progress visualization
- **MISCELLANEOUS/**: Feedback logs and reflections

## Success Criteria

- Average assessment score: 90%+ across 24 weeks
- LeetCode problems solved: 150+ (optimal solutions)
- Projects completed: 45+ with full documentation
- Test coverage: 90%+ average across projects
- Mock interview pass rate: 95%+
- ThinkBridge assessment simulation: 95%+ accuracy

## Approach

This plan follows a "brick by brick" incremental approach inspired by world-class engineering practices:

- Prioritized skill development based on ThinkBridge requirements and career goals
- Daily measurable objectives with specific metrics (latency reductions, test scores, code quality)
- Weekly assessments and monthly retrospectives
- Continuous feedback integration from mentors and peers
- Production-ready projects demonstrating real-world impact
