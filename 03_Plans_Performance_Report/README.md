# Week X Performance Report

## Planned vs Actual

| Metric             | Planned | Actual | Delta | Status          |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------ | ----- | --------------- |
| Assessment Score   | 90%     | 87%    | -3%   | ⚠️ Below target |
| Projects Completed | 3       | 3      | 0     | ✅ On track     |
| Study Hours        | 42      | 38     | -4    | ⚠️ Below target |

## Analysis

"I hit 87% on the assessment instead of 90% because I underestimated CSS Grid complexity. Next week, I'll allocate 3 extra hours to layout systems and complete 10 more Grid exercises."

## Adjustments

- Add 3 hours CSS Grid deep dive (Tuesday evening)
- Reduce social media to 30 min/day (was 1 hour)
- Set up Anki flashcards for CSS properties
