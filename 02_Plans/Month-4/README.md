# Month 4 Learning Plan: SQL, JDBC & Spring Boot

### Industry-standard Detailed Execution Document

---

## Overview

This month targets backend robustness via database mastery and enterprise Java frameworks. You will master SQL querying and optimization, JDBC database connectivity, and RESTful API development with Spring Boot. Deliverables include microservices and production-ready backend applications with a target assessment score ≥88%.

---

## Monthly Goals

- Master SQL syntax, normalization, indexing, and advanced querying
- Build efficient and secure database connections with JDBC and connection pooling
- Design REST APIs using Spring Boot with dependency injection, JPA, exception handling
- Validate backend services via unit and integration testing
- Deploy backend applications to cloud platforms
- Complete 35+ production-grade projects integrating database and backend logic

---

## Execution Model: 5+2 Structure

| Day      | Activity                                   | Notes                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Mon-Fri  | Backend learning, coding, testing, commits | 7-9 hrs/day, focused delivery         |
| Saturday | Full rest or emergency max 4 hrs catch-up  | Critical fixes only, long breaks      |
| Sunday   | Full mandatory rest                        | Mental refresh, no coding or planning |

---

## Daily Workflow (Mon-Fri)

- Morning: Concept study + hands-on development
- Afternoon: Build, test, document backend projects
- Evening: Review day’s progress, plan next day, mental closure

---

## Mental Health & Discipline Strategy

- Two full rest days foster memory consolidation, avoid burnout, enhance problem-solving, and boost long-term retention
- Discipline means enduring consistency with strategic rest
- Strict weekend protection sustains 6-month peak performance

| Approach             | Early Output | End Output        | Burnout Risk | Quality                 |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| 7-day grind          | High         | Crashed/Low       | 95%          | Poor                    |
| 5-day focus + 2 rest | High         | High (maintained) | 5%           | Excellent (Recommended) |

---

## Crisis Protocol: Saturday Catch-Up

- Only if <80% assessment by Thu, missed deadlines, or >2 missed days Mon-Fri
- Max 4 focused hours fixing gaps
- No new learning started
- Sunday always fully off

---

## GitHub Workflow

- Weekly feature branches (`feature/sql-design`, `feature/jdbc-conn`, `feature/spring-boot-api`)
- Frequent meaningful commits linked to tasks
- Weekly reviews before merge to main branch

---

## Key Success Metrics

- Assessment scores ≥88% per week/month
- 35+ production-quality projects combining SQL, JDBC, Spring Boot
- ≥85% code test coverage
- Fast query performances (<100ms to <300ms latency)
- Complete full-stack app deployed by month-end
- Strong code documentation and deployment infrastructure

---

## Engineering Philosophy

- Deliver incremental, testable, deployable backend “microservices” weekly
- Prioritize measurable, performant, clean-coded, production-ready deliverables
- Balance theory and practical project engineering rigor
- Implement scalable, secure, and maintainable backend architectures

---

## Summary

Month 4 embeds deep backend skills essential for professional-grade Java development and positions you for enterprise backend roles. Following the proven **5+2 sustainable cadence** and structured incremental delivery prepares you to build scalable, secure, and well-tested backend systems, ready for integration and deployment.
