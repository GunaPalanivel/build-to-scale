## Overview

Month 5 intensifies interview readiness by mastering advanced data structures, algorithms, and system design fundamentals. You will solve complex algorithmic problems, implement key data structures, and produce detailed system designs, preparing for elite technical interviews and leadership challenges.

**Target proficiency:** Precisely 9/10 across all topics.

---

## Monthly Goals

- Solve 70+ advanced LeetCode problems (120+ cumulative).
- Implement 12+ advanced data structures (AVL trees, Red-Black trees, graphs).
- Document 25+ algorithmic patterns (DP, greedy, backtracking).
- Design 6 detailed system architectures with diagrams and trade-offs.
- Conduct 4+ mock coding interviews with iterative feedback.
- Prepare 15 STAR behavioral stories aligned with leadership principles.
- Score ≥90% on end-of-month assessments.

---

## Study Schedule

- **Mon-Fri:** Intensive study, coding, and problem solving.
- **Saturday:** Project review, catch-up, reinforcement.
- **Sunday:** Assessment, reflection, planning.

## Execution Model: 5+2 Structure

| Day      | Activity                                             | Notes                                           |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Mon-Fri  | Learning, coding, reviewing                          | 7-9 hours/day with meaningful Git commits       |
| Saturday | Rest, integration, or emergency catch-up (max 4 hrs) | Critical fixes only; rest prioritized           |
| Sunday   | Full rest                                            | No work, no planning; mental recovery mandatory |

---

## Daily Workflow (Mon-Fri)

- Morning: Study topic + algorithm exploration
- Afternoon: Solve challenges + project implementations
- Evening: Review solutions + document learnings + plan next day

---

## Mental Health & Discipline Philosophy

- Two rest days key for cognitive consolidation, burnout prevention, and creative problem solving.
- Consistent execution at sustainable pace overrides burnout-prone intense sprints.
- Protecting rest days leads to high sustained output.

| Approach                 | Week 1-4 | Week 20-24 | Burnout Risk | Quality           |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ---------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| 7-day grind              | High     | Crashed    | 95%          | Poor              |
| **5-day focus + 2 rest** | High     | High       | 5%           | Excellent (ideal) |

---

## Crisis Protocol: Saturday Catch-Up

- Use only if assessment risk, deadline risk, or illness impacts ≥2 days Mon-Fri.
- Limit catch-up to 4 focused hours with adequate breaks.
- Sunday fully protected always.

---

## GitHub Workflow & Project Management

- Feature branches per weekly goal (`feature/dsa-advance`, `feature/system-design`)
- Frequent commits tied to deliverables and code reviews
- Weekly merges after peer feedback

---

## Engineering Philosophy

- Decompose months into deployable, testable microservice-like skill sprints.
- Embed quantitative metrics and peer feedback loops to track mastery.
- Balance technical depth with polished behavioral skills for holistic readiness.
