# Month 5: Advanced DSA & System Design

## Overview

Month 5 focuses on intensive interview preparation through mastering advanced data structures & algorithms (DSA) and system design fundamentals. This month sharpens problem-solving skills with complex algorithmic paradigms and prepares you to architect scalable, reliable systems—critical capabilities for elite technical interviews and real-world engineering leadership.

**Target skill level is exactly 9/10 for all topics—consistent with previous months.**

## Monthly Goals

- Solve 70+ advanced LeetCode problems, reaching 120+ cumulative total
- Implement 12+ advanced data structures from scratch (e.g., AVL trees, Red-Black trees, graphs)
- Understand and document 25+ algorithmic patterns (DP, greedy, backtracking)
- Design at least 6 detailed system design case studies with architecture diagrams and trade-off analysis
- Conduct 4+ mock coding interviews with peer or mentor feedback
- Prepare 15 STAR behavioral stories linking projects to leadership principles
- Score 90%+ on end-of-month assessments

## Engineering Approach & Philosophy

- Treat each week as a discrete deployable microservice of learning with defined input/output:
  - Input: current skill gaps prioritized by company and career goals
  - Output: quantifiable mastery in problem-solving and system design
- Use test-driven, measurable progress metrics to ensure alignment with product-based companies/top-tier tech companies standards
- Embed continuous feedback through weekly mock interviews and peer reviews to iterate rapidly
- Ground behavioral mastery on genuine experience and structured frameworks like LP-STAR
- Emulate principles seen in production: build incrementally, test thoroughly, reflect clearly
