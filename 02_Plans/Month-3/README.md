## Engineering Approach & Philosophy

### "I'm building Java skills like a distributed system"

Each week is a microservice in your backend engineering capability:

- **Week 9 (Fundamentals):** Core service—syntax, control structures, basic algorithms
- **Week 10 (OOP):** Architecture layer—design patterns, SOLID principles, maintainable code
- **Week 11 (Collections):** Data layer—optimal storage, retrieval, performance tuning
- **Week 12 (Exceptions & I/O):** Reliability layer—error handling, persistence, resilience

Just like at Stripe or Google, each component must be:

- **Well-tested:** Every project includes error handling and edge cases
- **Performant:** Measure complexity, optimize where needed
- **Documented:** Clear README, UML diagrams, inline comments for complex logic
- **Production-ready:** Follows Java conventions, no warnings, passes code review

### Trade-off Analysis in Learning

"I chose Java over Python for backend because enterprise systems demand strong typing, JVM performance for high throughput (10K+ QPS), and mature frameworks like Spring. The trade-off is steeper learning curve, but the payoff is backend roles at scale."

"I'm using ArrayList for student management because we need fast random access (O(1) lookup by index). If we needed frequent insertions at arbitrary positions, I'd reconsider LinkedList despite its O(n) access time."

## Important Notes

- **Target skill level:** Exactly **9/10** for all Month 3 skills—no more, no less
- **Saturday consolidation:** Review weak topics, integrate concepts into projects, apply feedback
- **Sunday assessment:** Quantify learning with tests; rest is critical to avoid burnout
- **GitHub commits:** Minimum 10 meaningful commits per week with descriptive messages
- **Code quality:** Zero critical errors (compiler, linter), follow Oracle Java Code Conventions
- **LeetCode/HackerRank:** Daily practice embeds algorithmic thinking and pattern recognition

---

## Continuous Feedback Loop

### Weekly Self-Review Questions

1. Can I explain encapsulation vs abstraction to a non-technical person?
2. Do I choose the right collection for each use case without hesitation?
3. Can I debug exceptions by reading stack traces alone?
4. Are my projects production-ready or just "working code"?

### Metrics to Track Weekly

- Assessment scores (target: ≥88% weekly, ≥90% monthly)
- LeetCode problems solved (target: 50+ cumulative by end of month)
- Code review feedback addressed (target: 100%)
- Project completion rate (target: 2-3 per week)

_This foundation enables Month 4's shift to databases (SQL, JDBC) and enterprise frameworks (Spring Boot), completing your backend engineering stack._
