# Month 3 Learning Plan: Java Fundamentals & Data Structures

### Industry-standard Detailed Execution Document

---

## Overview

Month 3 transitions from frontend/Firebase to backend fundamentals focusing on Java mastery. Target skill level is **9/10 exactly** across syntax, OOP, collections, error handling, and file I/O. These skills are foundational for backend and systems engineering roles essential in elite product companies.

---

## Monthly Goals

- Master Java syntax, control flow, core programming fundamentals
- Internalize OOP pillars and SOLID principles
- Gain fluency with Java Collections and optimize data structure usage
- Develop robust exception handling and high-performance file I/O skills
- Solve 50+ algorithmic problems primarily in Java
- Deliver 10+ production-quality Java projects with full documentation and tests
- Achieve 90%+ on monthly comprehensive assessment

---

## Weekly Breakdown

### Week 9: Java Core Fundamentals

- Setup dev environment, practice primitives, control flow, methods, arrays, strings
- Build command-line calculator with full error handling
- Solve 35+ HackerRank and LeetCode problems

### Week 10: Object-Oriented Programming

- Master encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction
- Build library and bank management systems demonstrating OOP concepts and SOLID
- Comprehensive UML and documentation

### Week 11: Java Collections Framework

- Master List, Set, Map, Queue interfaces and implementations
- Build student management system using optimal data structures for performance
- Implement a custom ArrayList, analyze performance trade-offs

### Week 12: Exception Handling & File I/O

- Master exception hierarchies, custom exceptions, best practices
- Build robust input validators with custom exceptions
- Develop file explorer and high-performance log analyzer with Java NIO
- Process large files efficiently with memory profiling

## Execution Model: 5+2 Structure

| Day      | Activity                                  | Notes                                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Mon-Fri  | Focused study, coding, problem-solving    | 7-9 hours daily, meaningful Git commits |
| Saturday | Full rest or max 4 hrs emergency catch-up | Critical only, mental breaks included   |
| Sunday   | Full mandatory rest                       | Mental reset, no work or planning       |

---

## Daily Workflow (Mon-Fri)

- Morning: Java concepts + hands-on coding
- Afternoon: Project implementation + algorithm practice + documentation
- Evening: Review, plan next day, mental closure

---

## Mental Health & Discipline Strategy

- 2 rest days promote **memory consolidation, burnout prevention, and creative problem solving**
- Discipline means **consistency with sustainability**, not exhaustion
- Strict rest preserves mental clarity across 6-month journey

---

## Crisis Protocol: Saturday Catch-Up Usage

- Use only if: risk of failing assessments (<80%), critical deadline missed, or ≥2 days missed previously
- Limit to 4 focused hours with breaks; no new learning started
- Sunday strictly off

---

## GitHub Workflow

- One feature branch per week (`feature/java-core-fundamentals`, `feature/java-oop`, etc.)
- Frequent meaningful commits linked to milestones
- Weekly review and merge to main

---

## Success Metrics

- ≥88% weekly and ≥90% monthly assessments
- 50+ Java programs & algorithm challenges completed
- 10+ production-quality projects with comprehensive documentation
- HackerRank and LeetCode daily practice embedded
- Java core proficiency at 8.5/10 by month end
- Clear UML and SOLID adherence demonstrated

---

## Engineering Philosophy

- Build Java backend like modular microservices: Fundamentals → OOP → Collections → Reliability
- Every project is tested, performant, documented, and production-ready
- Trade-offs in collections and error handling are deliberate to mirror enterprise-grade software practices

---

## Summary

Month 3 develops robust backend fundamentals critical for your transition to scalable backend engineering. Following the Industry-standard **5+2 execution model**, focused daily workflows, disciplined rest, and incremental project delivery will build your Java expertise and position you for months 4-6 focusing on databases and frameworks.
