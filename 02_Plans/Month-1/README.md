## Execution Model: 5+2 Structure

| Day      | Activity                            | Notes                                               |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Mon-Fri  | Learn, build, test, problem-solve   | 7-9 hours/day focused execution, meaningful commits |
| Saturday | Full rest (or max 4 hours catch-up) | Critical only; breaks mandatory; no new topics      |
| Sunday   | Full mental rest                    | Non-negotiable; disconnect fully                    |

---

## Daily Workflow (Mon-Fri)

- **Morning:** Conceptual study + hands-on coding
- **Afternoon:** Project development + algorithm practice + documentation
- **Evening:** Review day’s learning, plan tomorrow, mental closure

---

## Mental Health & Discipline Rationale

- **Memory consolidation** improves with sleep and rest days
- **Burnout risk minimized** using structured rest and reflection
- **Creative problem solving** peaks with mental freshness
- **Long-term retention** achieved through spaced repetition & breaks

| Approach             | Week 1-4 Output | Week 20-24 Output | Burnout Risk | Quality   |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| 7-day grind          | High            | Crashed/Low       | 95%          | Poor      |
| 5-day focus + 2 rest | High            | High (sustained)  | 5%           | Excellent |

> _“I'm not trying to win Week 1. I'm trying to still be executing at peak performance in Week 24.”_

---

## Crisis Protocol for Saturday Catch-Up

Only apply if:

- Risk of failing ThinkBridge assessment (<80% score by Thursday)
- Critical project deadline Friday with less than 50% progress by Thursday
- More than 2 missed days Mon-Fri due to emergencies

Rules:

- Max 4 focused hours, no all-day grinding
- Fix existing gaps only
- Take long breaks for mental reset
- Sunday always fully protected

---

## GitHub Workflow

- One feature branch per weekly focus (e.g., `feature/html5-mastery`)
- Commits reflect small, incremental deliverables
- Weekly merge into main after thorough review

---

## Summary

Month 1 is a **foundational sprint** that lays the bedrock for the full 6-month scalable learning plan. By following the **5+2 model**, executing focused daily workflows, integrating rest strategically, and managing projects with Git branching discipline, you build core front-end mastery critical for apprenticeship success and beyond.

This approach mirrors that of top engineers at Product-based companies/Top-tier tech companies: **actionable, measurable, and sustainable growth guaranteed by mental clarity and expert-level execution standards.**
