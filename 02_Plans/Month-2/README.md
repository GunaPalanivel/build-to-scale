---

## Overview

Month 2 elevates foundational JavaScript and front-end skills to advanced, production-ready web engineering. Focus areas span deep Firebase integration and sophisticated JavaScript patterns, culminating in shipping a full e-commerce platform with testing and automation matching product-grade engineering.

_Target proficiency across all skills: 9/10 (strict cap)_

---

## Monthly Goals

- Master Firebase Auth, Firestore fundamentals, security, and monitoring.
- Implement Firebase Cloud Functions, file storage, and admin tooling for scalable apps.
- Advance JavaScript skills with design patterns, testing frameworks, CI/CD pipelines.
- Ship a full-fledged e-commerce platform incrementally, emphasizing quality, performance, and documentation.
- Score 90%+ on all weekly/monthly assessments.
- Maintain rigorous Git commit discipline with detailed, data-driven READMEs.

## Execution Model: 5+2 Structure

| Day      | Activity                                  | Notes                                         |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Mon-Fri  | Deep learning, building, testing          | 7–9 focused hours, meaningful commits per day |
| Saturday | Full rest or max 4 hrs emergency catch-up | Critical only; mental breaks mandatory        |
| Sunday   | Full mandatory rest                       | Mental reset, hobbies, no work or planning    |

---

## Daily Workflow (Mon-Fri)

- Morning: Concept learning + hands-on coding
- Afternoon: Project coding + problem-solving + documentation
- Evening: Review, plan next day, mental closure

---

## Mental Health & Discipline Strategy

- Rest days enable **memory consolidation, burnout prevention, creative problem-solving**, and **long-term retention**.
- Discipline favors **consistency with sustainability**, not exhaustion.
- Protect rest days strictly, enabling peak performance across 6 months.

| Approach                        | Week 1-4 | Week 20-24 | Burnout Risk | Outcome                 |
| ------------------------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| 7-day continuous grind          | High     | Crashed    | 95%          | Poor                    |
| **5-day focused + 2 rest days** | High     | Sustained  | 5%           | Excellent (recommended) |

---

## Crisis Protocol: Saturday Catch-Up Usage

Use only if:

- Risk of failing ThinkBridge assessment (<80% by Thursday)
- Critical Friday deadline with <50% progress by Thursday eve
- ≥2 Mon-Fri missed days due to emergencies

Rules:

- Limit catch-up to 4 focused hours with planned breaks
- Fix only critical gaps; no new learning
- Sunday always fully protected

---

## GitHub Workflow & Project Management

- Feature branch per weekly milestone (`feature/firebase-auth`, `feature/js-testing`, etc.)
- Commit often with meaningful messages; link commits to project milestones
- Review code weekly before merging to main branch

---

## Summary

Month 2 is a critical acceleration phase—deeply integrating backend Firebase skills, advanced JS engineering best practices, and full-stack production readiness. Execution adheres to the **5+2 sustainable method** ensuring mental clarity and consistent progression. This plan, mirroring senior engineer workflows at Product-based companies/Top-tier tech companies, balances technical depth with operational discipline necessary for high-impact delivery and career growth.
