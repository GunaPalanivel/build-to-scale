## Overview

Month 2 elevates you from frontend and core JavaScript fundamentals to advanced, production-ready web engineering. The focus is split between deep Firebase integration (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions, Security, Monitoring) and taking JavaScript into advanced patterns and robust full-stack workflows. The final two weeks emphasize testing, automation, and shipping a complete e-commerce platform—mirroring product-based companies-level engineering delivery.

**Target skill level for all areas this month is 9/10—no more, no less.**

## Meta-Notes & Philosophy

- **Target Level:** All skills capped/focused at exactly 9/10 proficiency.
- **Saturdays:** Dedicated to integration, reinforcement, performance testing, and feedback-driven refactor.
- **Sundays:** Reserved for rest or light catch-up if absolutely required for sustainability.
- **Documentation:** Every significant project, feature, or refactor must be accompanied by a git commit and a clear, data-driven README.
