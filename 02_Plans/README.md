# Learning Plans: Week-by-Week Roadmap with 5-Day Study Week

## Overview

This roadmap breaks your 6-month, 24-week (total 168 days) plan into focused learning blocks:

- Study on 5 days each week (Monday to Friday focus)
- 6th day (Saturday) - catch-up, revision, reinforcement, or rest depending on progress
- Sunday as rest or light reflection day (optional)

Effectively:

- 5 study days x 24 weeks = 120 focused learning days
- 24 Saturdays to fix gaps, catch errors, review tough concepts
- Sundays light/non-study days to avoid burnout

---

## Structure

- 6 Months: Month-1 through Month-6
- 24 Weeks: Week-1 through Week-24
- Days:
  - Day-01_plan.md to Day-05_plan.md per week for learning
  - Day-06_plan.md per week for review/correction/revision
  - Day-07_plan.md optional reflection (or skipped)

## Incremental "Brick by Brick" Realistic Approach

"I'm thinking of each week as a microservice:

- Days 1-5: Feature development (core skills, projects, problems)
- Day 6: Monitoring & fixes (revision, catch-up, reinforce weak spots)
- Day 7: Maintenance (reflection/planning/rest)"

This keeps pace manageable, reduces burnout risks, and aligns with engineering iterative best practices.

## Example Week Template

| Day   | Activity                        | Focus                                   | Goal/Metric                  |
| ----- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Day 1 | Concept study + small exercises | Learning new topic area                 | Complete 2 exercises         |
| Day 2 | Hands-on coding project feature | Build or extend project feature         | Commit + Push code           |
| Day 3 | Problem-solving session         | Solve algorithm problems                | Solve 3 problems             |
| Day 4 | Testing & debugging             | Write tests/refactor                    | 90%+ code coverage           |
| Day 5 | Knowledge integration           | Read docs, watch tutorials, soft skills | 1 behavioral story written   |
| Day 6 | Review & reinforce (catch-up)   | Fix bugs, review failed questions       | Reduce error count by X%     |
| Day 7 | Reflection / Rest (optional)    | Plan next week, mental reset            | Write progress journal entry |

## Total Days Breakdown

- 24 weeks × 5 active days = **120 learning days** with structured growth goals
- 24 Saturdays = **24 review days** dedicated to bug fixing, reinforcing learning, and closing gaps
- Sundays left flexible for rest or light cognitive tasks to sustain endurance.
