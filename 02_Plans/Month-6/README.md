## Execution Model: 5+2 Structure

| Day      | Activity                                            | Notes                                     |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Mon-Fri  | Intensive study, mock interviews, portfolio updates | Meaningful commits daily; focused sprints |
| Saturday | Rest or max 4 hrs critical catch-up                 | Ensures mental freshness                  |
| Sunday   | Full rest and light reflection                      | Critical for sustaining momentum          |

---

## Daily Workflow (Mon-Fri)

- Morning: Simulation practice or content review
- Afternoon: Project polish, mock interview, problem solving
- Evening: Debrief, document, next day planning

---

## Mental Health & Discipline Philosophy

- Rest days are scientifically proven to consolidate memory, prevent burnout, and stimulate creativity
- Consistent 5-day work with 2-day rest minimizes risk of exhaustion, sustaining peak performance
- Rest is a tool for excellence, not downtime to be skipped

| Approach                 | Week 1-4 | Week 20-24 | Burnout Risk | Quality   |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------- |
| 7-day grind              | High     | Crashed    | 95%          | Poor      |
| **5-day focus + 2 rest** | High     | High       | 5%           | Excellent |
