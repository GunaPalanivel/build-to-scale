# Build to Scale: 6-Month Engineering Excellence Roadmap

## Overview

This repository documents a comprehensive, metrics-driven 6-month learning journey designed to transform a software engineering graduate into a top 0.0001% candidate ready for elite product companies (FAANG, Stripe, Uber, etc.) and the ThinkBridge Software Engineer Apprentice Program.

## Objectives

- Master HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+, Firebase (ThinkBridge assessment tech stack)
- Build Java expertise for long-term backend career growth
- Achieve 9/10 proficiency across all critical skill areas
- Complete 45+ production-quality projects with measurable impact
- Pass 95%+ of mock technical and behavioral interviews
- Develop systems thinking with trade-off analysis and scale awareness

## Repository Structure

- **PLANS/**: Week-by-week learning plans (24 weeks, 168 days)
- **PLANS_PERFORMANCE_REPORT/**: Actual vs expected outcomes tracking
- **PROJECTS/**: Source code and documentation for all projects
- **ASSESSMENTS/**: Weekly and monthly skill assessments
- **BEHAVIORAL_PREP/**: Interview stories using LP-STAR framework
- **SYSTEM_DESIGN/**: Architecture case studies and diagrams
- **RESOURCES/**: Curated learning materials
- **TOOLS_SETUP/**: Development environment configurations
- **METRICS/**: KPI tracking and progress visualization
- **MISCELLANEOUS/**: Feedback logs and reflections

## Success Criteria

- Average assessment score: 90%+ across 24 weeks
- LeetCode problems solved: 150+ (optimal solutions)
- Projects completed: 45+ with full documentation
- Test coverage: 90%+ average across projects
- Mock interview pass rate: 95%+
- ThinkBridge assessment simulation: 95%+ accuracy

## Approach

This plan follows a "brick by brick" incremental approach inspired by world-class engineering practices:

- Prioritized skill development based on ThinkBridge requirements and career goals
- Daily measurable objectives with specific metrics (latency reductions, test scores, code quality)
- Weekly assessments and monthly retrospectives
- Continuous feedback integration from mentors and peers
- Production-ready projects demonstrating real-world impact

## Engineering Mindset

"I chose Redis because we needed sub-100ms reads—not because it's trendy. This scales to 50K QPS; beyond that, we'd shard. I learned this optimizing a side project where latency killed retention."

This repository embodies technical depth, clear reasoning, trade-off analysis, and collaborative problem-solving expected at top-tier companies.

## Priority Justification

### CRITICAL Priority (Weeks 1-8)

Skills required for ThinkBridge's 6-week assessment program. Failure to master these blocks apprenticeship offer.

**Focus:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+, Firebase

**Rationale:** "These are non-negotiable. The assessment is pass/fail on these four technologies. I need sub-50ms DOM manipulation, pixel-perfect responsive layouts, and real-time Firebase sync under 200ms latency."

---

### HIGH Priority (Weeks 9-20)

Skills critical for long-term career progression and backend specialization.

**Focus:** Java, DSA, SQL, Spring Boot, Behavioral Skills

**Rationale:** "Java and Spring Boot open backend roles at scale. I've seen Java dominate enterprise and fintech—companies I want to work at use it. DSA determines if I pass FAANG coding rounds. SQL optimizes every data-heavy system I'll touch."

---

### MEDIUM Priority (Continuous & Weeks 19-24)

Skills that enhance but don't block core objectives.

**Focus:** System Design, Advanced Git, CI/CD, Testing

**Rationale:** "System design matters at senior levels, but I need coding fundamentals first. Git and CI/CD are continuous improvement—I'll use them daily but won't dedicate focused weeks unless gaps appear."

---

## Quantified Gap Analysis

**Total Skill Points to Gain:** 28.5 points across 12 skill areas  
**Weeks Available:** 24 weeks  
**Average Weekly Gain Required:** 1.19 skill points/week

**Risk Areas (Gap > 2.5 points):**

- Firebase Suite: 3.0 gap → Weeks 5-6 intensive focus
- Java Core: 3.5 gap → Weeks 9-12 + 14-16 sustained effort

---

## Success Metrics

### Week 4 Checkpoint (Month 1)

- HTML/CSS/JS: 9.0+/10 avg
- 20+ projects completed
- 90%+ assessment scores

### Week 8 Checkpoint (Month 2)

### Month 6: Interview Mastery & Production Polish (Weeks 21-24)

**Goal:** ThinkBridge simulation and portfolio refinement  
**Deliverables:** 95%+ simulation score, 45+ projects, 95%+ mock interview pass rate

## How to Use

Each week folder contains:

- **README.md**: Weekly objectives, success metrics, deliverables
- **day-XX_plan.md**: Daily tasks (morning, afternoon, evening blocks)

Each day plan includes:

- Learning objectives (2-3 hours study)
- Hands-on practice (3-4 hours coding)
- Assessment/review (1 hour reflection)
- Measurable outcomes (problems solved, features built, scores achieved)

## Incremental "Brick by Brick" Approach

"I'm not cramming—this is like building a distributed system. Each week is a service, each day is a feature. I commit small, test often, and iterate based on feedback. By Week 24, these bricks form a production-ready skill set."

---

**WIP:** Weekly and daily plans will be documented progressively per phase schedule. Phase 1 will populate Month 1 plans.
```

### `PLANS_PERFORMANCE_REPORT/README.md`

```markdown
# Performance Reports: Tracking Expected vs Actual Outcomes

## Purpose

This folder tracks the delta between planned objectives and actual achievements, providing data-driven insights for continuous improvement.

## Report Structure

### Weekly Reports

- Planned metrics vs actual results
- Time spent per activity
- Challenges faced and mitigations
- Adjustments needed for next week

### Monthly Reports

- Aggregate weekly performance
- Skill level progress (current vs target)
- Assessment score trends
- Project completion rate
- Feedback from mentors/peers
- Strategic adjustments for next month

## Key Metrics Tracked

### Technical Metrics

- Assessment scores (target: 90%+ avg)
- LeetCode problems solved (target: 150+ total)
- Projects completed (target: 45+ total)
- Test coverage % (target: 90%+ avg)
- Performance improvements (latency, throughput)
- Code quality scores (ESLint, SonarQube)

### Behavioral Metrics

- Mock interview pass rate (target: 95%+)
- STAR stories prepared (target: 15+)
- Presentation feedback scores
- Peer review participation

### Productivity Metrics

- Daily study hours (target: 6 hours avg)
- GitHub commits (target: 600+ over 6 months)
- Streak days (target: 168 consecutive days)

## Example Weekly Report Format
```

# Week X Performance Report

## Planned vs Actual

| Metric             | Planned | Actual | Delta | Status          |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------ | ----- | --------------- |
| Assessment Score   | 90%     | 87%    | -3%   | ⚠️ Below target |
| Projects Completed | 3       | 3      | 0     | ✅ On track     |
| Study Hours        | 42      | 38     | -4    | ⚠️ Below target |

## Analysis

"I hit 87% on the assessment instead of 90% because I underestimated CSS Grid complexity. Next week, I'll allocate 3 extra hours to layout systems and complete 10 more Grid exercises."

## Adjustments

- Add 3 hours CSS Grid deep dive (Tuesday evening)
- Reduce social media to 30 min/day (was 1 hour)
- Set up Anki flashcards for CSS properties

```
